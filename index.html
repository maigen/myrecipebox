<!-- while not nessisarily a matter of improvement functionaliy wise it is recomended the white space be filled as the 
 recipe page be developed, as it is is a personal website for me I have not added recipes or other functions to
 the page. Similarly this is why navigation page was removed, there was no page to switch to and as such they werent nessisary
 , however the nav section was still included in case they need to be added back  -->
